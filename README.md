# Ohm Trader!

RAHHHH

## What is Ohm Trader?

Ohm Trader is a paper stock trading bot that makes arbitrary trades in order to prove algorithmic trading is a mere
farce. It buys one share of a *random* company at the beginning of each weekday, and it will hold it for one week until that weekday comes along again.

## Wouldn't it lose money since it can't consider previous patterns?

That's the neat part, it ~~won't~~ shouldn't! My hypothesis is that as long as you aren't trading complete random,
bullshit companies, you will make money in a neutral or bull market.

## Why would you waste your money on this?

Ohm Trader only makes paper trades, so no actual money is lost. However, the program can be modified to make actual
trades, but instructions won't be provided for liability's sake. I do not endorse using this bot for real trading.

## How do I run Ohm Trader?

You should just be able to run the jar downloadable under releases, but if you compile it from scratch, make sure to refresh Maven. (This is my first project, so if there are any errors, feel free to create a PR to correct them.)
