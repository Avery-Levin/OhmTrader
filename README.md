# Ohm Trader!
RAHHHH
## What is Ohm Trader?
  Ohm Trader is a paper stock trading bot that makes arbitrary trades in order to prove algorithmic trading is a mere farce. It buys one share of a *random* company at the beginning of the day, and it will hold it until the beginning of the next day, when it will buy a new stock.


## Wouldn't it lose money since it can't consider previous patterns?
That's the neat part, it ~~won't~~ shouldn't! My hypothesis is that as long as you aren't trading complete random, bullshit companies, you will make money in a neutral or bull market.

## Why would you waste your money on this?
Ohm Trader only makes paper trades, so no actual money is lost. However, the program can be modified to make actual trades, but instructions won't be provided for liability's sake.

## How do I run Ohm Trader?
TODO, finish the bot first.
